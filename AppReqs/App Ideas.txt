MadHouse – Interactive Family Planning App
Purpose of this document
This document captures the full concept, design rationale, and technical direction for the MadHouse app. It is written so that if this file is reintroduced later, work can resume without relying on prior conversation context.

1. Core Idea Summary
MadHouse is a family planning and organization app that reduces mental load by mapping everyday responsibilities to a familiar house-based interface.
Instead of traditional menus and tabs, users navigate a virtual home. Each room represents a category of family life, and interactive objects inside each room open related tools.
The goal is to make planning feel intuitive, visual, and lightly playful without becoming a full game.

2. Design Philosophy
Guiding Principles
• Familiar spaces reduce cognitive load
• Visual context is more memorable than lists
• Interaction should feel rewarding but not distracting
• Graphics enhance clarity, not replace usability
What This Is Not
• Not a 3D game engine experience
• Not free-roam character movement
• Not heavy animation or physics-driven gameplay
This is an interactive 2D illustrated application.

3. House-Based Navigation Model
High-Level Structure
• Home view shows the house
• Each room is a screen
• Objects within rooms are tappable zones
• Tools open as modals, panels, or overlays
This preserves the feeling of being “in the room” while keeping navigation efficient.

Gamification is subtle and environmental, not point-heavy.

Recommendations for Mobile Feasibility
                                    1. Stick to MVP First – Start with Kitchen core features only. Make sure UI feels smooth and tappable objects respond quickly.

                                    2. Lazy Load Rooms – Only load room assets when entering a room. Don’t preload every image and animation on app start.

                                    3. Optimize Animations – Use lightweight transitions and small SVGs rather than frame-heavy sequences.

                                    4. Modular Backend Design – Keep room data separate, sync independently, and allow offline caching.

                                    5. Gamification Optional – Don’t overdo sparkles or streaks in MVP; add them gradually.
